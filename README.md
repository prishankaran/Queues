1] SET and GET

![alt tag](snapshots/2.jpg)

As can be seen from the image, the value of the specified key has been set to the string "the message will self-destruct in 10 seconds"

![alt tag](snapshots/3.jpg)

As expected, the string expired to be the value after 10 seconds, which can also be seen from the command window, where the value is printed as null.

2] RECENT

![alt tag](snapshots/recent1.jpg)

The image above clearly shows the 5 most recent visited urls.

![alt tag](snapshots/recent2.jpg)

Furthermore, the next image is a result of calling recent again, only once. As can be seen, it is the first url visible, and the 5 most recent urls can be seen.

3] Additional server instance:

![alt tag](snapshots/instance.jpg)

As can be seen from the image, 2 instances of the server are running, one on port 3000, and the other on 3001.
